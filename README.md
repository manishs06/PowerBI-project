# Global Energy Trends Report

# Introduction

The global energy landscape has undergone significant changes over the past few decades, with different regions contributing to the consumption and production of energy in varying capacities. This report presents an analysis of global energy consumption trends, sources of energy, and the leading nations in energy production and utilization.

# Global Energy Consumption Trends

•	Asia remains the continent with the highest energy consumption, with China leading among all countries in power usage.
•	The sum of total energy consumption across the top-consuming countries ranged between 12.40 TWh and 1819.94 TWh.
•	The energy consumption of major economic groups, including OECD, BRICS, and CIS, highlights significant variations in consumption patterns.
# Energy Production: Sources and Distribution

•	Renewable energy sources constitute a significant portion of global power generation, with the leading contributors being:
•	Tidal Energy: 42.95%
•	Hydro Power: 21.78%
•	Wind Energy: 14.1%
•	Biofuel: 12.99%
•	Solar PV: 5.82%

•	Non-renewable energy continues to dominate global energy production, with the primary contributors being:

•	Coal: 50%
•	Natural Gas: 25.36%
•	Nuclear: 15.12%
•	Oil: 6.78%
•	The report indicates a steady rise in hydroelectric power over the last three decades, signifying its potential as a sustainable source.

# Renewable Power Generation Trends (1997-2017)

•	Over the past few decades, the adoption of renewable energy sources has shown positive growth.
•	Biofuel energy ranged from 3.88 TWh to 1,127.31 TWh.
•	Geothermal energy varied between 36.42 TWh and 85.34 TWh.
•	Hydro energy saw a significant increase, ranging from 21,191.67 TWh to 4,192.29 TWh.
•	Top Energy-Producing Countries
•	The leading nations in energy production include China, the USA, Brazil, Canada, India, Germany, Russia, Japan, France, Italy, and the UK.
•	Among renewable energy sources, hydro energy is most prominent in Canada and Brazil, whereas solar and wind energy have seen significant investment in Europe and North America.

# Energy Consumption in Africa

•	The continent's energy consumption has gradually increased, with leading consumers including South Africa, Algeria, Nigeria, and Egypt.
•	While Africa remains a lower consumer compared to other regions, its energy demand is growing steadily with increased investments in renewable energy sources.
